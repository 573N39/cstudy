        <h2>Fundamentals of C</h2>
        <p>The basic code names and the functions of C; functions for basic input/output, easy expressions and the words that are used in C.</p>
        <h3>Basic structure</h3>
        <p>To give a simple output of literal string, we use the function printf().
        Here we have the basic structure of a C program.</p>
        <img src = "hello.jpg" width = 50%>
        <p>The code has 'directive; standard input/output(#include<stdio.h>)', and the function int main(void), then the statement printf() where printf() is a function too but placed as a statment; a function-call. printf("Hello World") can show the literalstring Hello World on the console screen. A crucial part to know is that if it's just written printf("Hello World");, then the next words are continued on the same line instead of starting from the next, so we have to use \n to continue the next words from next line. For example, printf("Hello World\n");. Also, in statements we have to end most of the functions or expressiosn with a semicolon because it means a fullstop of a sentence to them.</p>

        <p>As shown in the above image, \n had used in printf() function and before seeing how it would be shown on the console, let's check out what it means for the blue words at the top of the code. Basically they are <strong>Comments</strong> that the programmers use not to make an output on the console but to make some notes within the codes for the understanding sakes. There are 2 types; // and /**/. If we write /*Hello*/ then the word Hello becomes just a comment that effects nothing to the code. It doesn't matter of the lines and spaces but the comment must begin with /* and closed by */ or else if we don't close the comment, C understands everything after /* as comments. // is a new tech of C99 that makes an end of a comment automatically after a line's written. // is good for a short one-lined comment.</p>
