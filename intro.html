        <p>The C Language was developed at <strong title = "Ken Thomson had created B Language earlier for the same issue of building C">Bell-Labs by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thomson and Brian Kernighan</strong> in 1969 to have a better condition of computing in <strong title = "Firstly with DEC PDP-7 that could hold just 8k of words for its main memory">UNIX system</strong> as Assembly or basic computer language wasn't quite efficient to use. Due to its highly flexible and portable nature, many C programmers had their own theories of using the language thus it required a standard base, so then it was approved by ANSI(American National Standard Institute) in Dec 1989 and even approved by ISO(Organization for International Standardization) in 1990 and it made this version of C to be called as C89/90. Later ISO had publicated new version of the standard in 1999; C99. Today we have even C11(2011) but it says that old ANSI and ISO C89/99 are better prefered. It's important to decide which reference of C to be used, to study the standards rather than the "illegals" first.</p>
        <h3>C-Based Languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C++</strong> An expension of C that normally recommended to study both C and C++.</li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong> It has the features of C but it's an object-oriented language.</li>
            <li><strong>C#</strong> Object-oriented, new and simpler.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Languages</h3>
        <p>Few other languages that are mostly used and good to learn.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> Beginner friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>PHP</strong> Required for dealing with server.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> Used for Webclient.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL</strong> Database and something for structural data.</li>
